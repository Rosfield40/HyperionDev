# A small repository of some beginner coding tasks.

# Finance_calculator.py allows simple calculation of investment or bond interest and repayable amounts

# Holiday.py gives a few options of locations to visit (values of hotels and rentals do not reflect real world costs) allows user input to generate how much a holiday would cost easy to navigate and customise own pricing

# menu.py a very basic menu list of a coffee shop that calculates from stock levels
